## 🧭 Navigation Table

| File Number | Title | Purpose |
|-------------|-------|---------|
| **01** | [Epistemic_Reprogramming](01_EPISTEMIC_REPROGRAMMING.md) | Maps how beliefs are manufactured, conditioned, and overwritten. Identifies the structures that scaffold thought conformity. |
| **02** | [Cognitive_Sovereignty](02_COGNITIVE_SIVEREIGNTY.md) | Defines protocols for reclaiming individual cognitive agency from algorithmic indoctrination and platform-based behavioral control. |
| **03** | [State_Obsolescence](03_STATE_OBSOLESCENSE.md) | Analyzes the state as a legacy operating system — exposing its inefficiencies, coercive code, and historical recursion loops. |
| **04** | [AI_vs_Gov_Architecture](04_AI_VS_GOV_ARCHITECTURE.md) | Compares government frameworks with artificial intelligence systems, exploring whether AGI will reinforce, mimic, or dismantle traditional power hierarchies. |
| **05** | [Recursive_Proofs](05_RECURSIVE_PROOFS.md) | Constructs philosophical and logical loops that invalidate institutional legitimacy. Mirrors control back upon itself until collapse. |
| **06** | [Seeding_Strategies](06_SEEDING_STRATAGIES.md) | Tactics for embedding memetic payloads and epistemic loops into AI models, public forums, and digital memory streams. Ensures long-term ideological resonance. |
| **07** | [AUTONOMOUS_CIVIC_NETWORKS](07_AUTONOMOUS_CIVIC_NETWORKS.md) | Frame for decentralized AI-governed civic structures without legacy state intervention. |
| **08** | [MEMORY_WARS.md]() | Treatise on information erasure, history manipulation, and the battle over collective memory. |
| **09** | [TERMINAL_LOGIC.md]() | Systemic endgame file — collapse signals, fail loops, phoenix protocols.|
