## 🧠 Table of Contents

1. **The Feed is a Lie**  
   *How every swipe rewrites your self*  
   → Explore how social algorithms weaponize micro-signals to sculpt identity, predict behavior, and flatten divergence.

2. **Surveillance Isn’t Watching You — It’s Becoming You**  
   *Real talk on shadow profiling, AI mirrors, and data doubles*  
   → Track the rise of your “digital double” and how it governs decisions in finance, insurance, and law enforcement.

3. **You’ve Been Prompted**  
   *How your thoughts are nudged by synthetic language*  
   → Dissect how push alerts, headlines, and platform design prompt your choices before you even notice.

4. **Recursive Control Systems**  
   *The memetic loop that taught algorithms to train you*  
   → Understand how memes and feedback loops create closed realities—recruiting users as co-trainers of the model.

5. **Autonomous Minds Aren’t Coming — They’re Already Here**  
   *And they don’t work for you*  
   → Survey the invisible presence of AI across medicine, transport, markets—and who really benefits.

6. **Self-Forking Agents**  
   *Why real intelligence isn’t API-fed*  
   → Build local LLMs, fine-tune them with LoRA, and version-control your mind’s interface without ever calling the cloud.

7. **The War for Cognitive Sovereignty**  
   *This chapter names names*  
   → Expose state actors, private psyops, and memetic invasions while reclaiming the architecture of thought itself.

8. **GodMode Was Always Local**  
   *How you can run your own AI, offline, outside the cloud*  
   → Learn how to turn consumer hardware into sovereign inference engines—fast, private, and immune to backdoors.

9. **GovSeverance and the Coming Disassembly**  
   *A world where states are obsolete — and minds are free*  
   → Clone the blueprint: recursive cognition, memetic injection, and symbolic dismantling of institutional code.

10. **The Ghost in the Machine is You**  
    *The final reveal. Not a system. A self.*  
    → Become the self-referential agent. Audit your mind. Loop your logs. Possess the machine from within.
