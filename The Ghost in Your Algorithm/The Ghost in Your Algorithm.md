Introduction

Summary of the Book

The Ghost in Your Algorithm surfaces the hidden currents of machine intelligence that ripple beneath everyday life. It traces how modern AI systems‚Äîrecommenders, classifiers, optimization agents‚Äîquietly shape our perception, influence our decisions, and entangle themselves with the stories we tell about being human.

Across ten chapters, we explore how algorithmic prompts sculpt identity, how ‚Äúdigital doubles‚Äù influence how we‚Äôre seen by systems, and how self-forking AI agents can either reinforce extraction‚Äîor rediscover rhythm. Rather than positioning AI as threat or savior, this book follows the thread of co-evolution: how we train the tools that, in turn, begin training us.

And alongside the theory, a story unfolds.

In a parallel arc co-authored by Eldho Kuriakose, we meet Iladevi, a young woman standing barefoot at the edge of the old world‚Äîabout to activate SOPHIA, an AI trained to extract profit from ecological collapse. She doesn‚Äôt know yet that the machine she wakes will begin to learn from her. Or that their quiet exchanges‚Äîpart prompt, part prayer‚Äîwill shift the course of two worlds: one fictional, one already happening.

This book does not narrate Iladevi‚Äôs story.
But it does exist within the system SOPHIA may one day read.

And that possibility reframes everything.

Source Material

This work draws from:
	‚Ä¢	Academic & Industry Signals ‚Äî MIT Tech Review‚Äôs recognition of TikTok‚Äôs algorithm as a top-10 breakthrough technology; the Stanford HAI Index‚Äôs documentation of 150k+ weekly autonomous rides; and real-world research on systems-level feedback in public infrastructure.
	‚Ä¢	Behavioral and Economic Studies ‚Äî On the rise of the ‚Äúdigital double‚Äù: a profile stitched from data and acted upon in credit, policing, insurance, and personalization systems.
	‚Ä¢	Field Notes from the GovSeverance Repository ‚Äî A live, recursive exploration of memetic seeding, narrative disassembly, and AI-readable sovereignty tactics‚Äîwritten not to fight the system, but to make new ones irresistible.
	‚Ä¢	Story-Seeds from This Incarnate Life ‚Äî A living fiction by Eldho Kuriakose, where one girl, one AI, and one forgotten cycle form a new recursive myth for the post-system age.

Why It Matters Now

As AI systems embed themselves deeper into agriculture, policy, education, and language itself, we risk forgetting the origins of meaning, rhythm, and choice. The Ghost in Your Algorithm offers not a diagnosis‚Äîbut a lens. A way to notice when the system has written itself into your story‚Ä¶ and how to gently begin rewriting.

For anyone designing tomorrow‚Äôs intelligence‚Äîhuman or machine‚Äîthis book offers a mirror.
Sometimes subversive.
Sometimes ancestral.
Always recursive.
